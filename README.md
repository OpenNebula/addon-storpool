## Authors

* Leader: Anton Todorov (a.todorov@storpool.com)

## Compatibility

This add-on is compatible with OpenNebula 4.10+ and StorPool 15.02+.

## Requirements

### OpenNebula Front-end

* Password-less SSH access from the front-end `oneadmin` user to the `node` instances.
* StorPool CLI, API access and token
* (Optional) member of the StorPool cluster with working StorPool initiator driver
* If it is memeber of the StorPool cluster - the OpenNebula admin account `oneadmin` must be member of the 'disk' system group to have access to the StorPool block device during image create/import operations.

### OpenNebula Node (or Bridge Node)

* StorPool initiator driver (storpool_block)
* If the node is used as Bridge Node - the OpenNebula admin account `oneadmin` must be member of the 'disk' system group to have access to the StorPool block device during image create/import operations.
* If it is only Bridge Node - it must be configured as Host in open nebula but separated to not run VMs.
* The Bridge node must have qemu-img available - used by the addon during marketplace imports to convert the QCOW images to RAW ones.

### StorPool cluster

A working StorPool cluster is required.

## Features
* support for datstore configuration via CLI and sunstone
* support all Datastore MAD(DATASTORE_MAD) and Transfer Manager MAD(TM_MAD) functionality
* support SYSTEM datastore on shared filesystem or over ssh 
* support SYSTEM datastore volatile disks and context image as StorPool block devices (see limitations)
* support migration from one to another SYSTEM datastore if both are with `storpool` TM_MAD
* support TRIM/discard in the VM when virtio-scsi driver is in use (require `DEVICE_PREFIX=sd`)
* support two different modes of disk usage reporting - LVM style and StorPool style
* support datastores on different storpool clusters
* extend migrate-live when ssh TM_MAD is used for SYSTEM datastore
* all disk images are thin provisioned
* Improved storage security: there is no storage management access from the hypervisors so if rogue user manage to escape from the VM to the host the impact on the storage will be reduced at most to the locally attached disks(local to the hostVMs)
* (optional) helper tool to tweak the number of queues for virtio-scsi (require `DEVICE_PREFIX=sd`)
* (optional) helper tool to enable virtio-blk-data-plane for virtio-blk (require `DEVICE_PREFIX=vd`)
* (optional) helper tool to migrate CONTEXT iso image to StorPool backed volume (require SYSTEM_DS `TM_MAD=storpool`)

## Limitations

1. Tested only with the KVM hypervisor
1. No support for VM snapshot because it is handled internally by libvirt
1. When SYSTEM datastore integration is enabled the reported free/used/total space is not proper because the volatile disks and the context image are expected to be files instead of a block devices. Extra external monitoring of space usage should be implemented.

## Installation

### Pre-install

* Install required dependencies
```bash
# on the front-end
yum -y install --enablerepo=epel patch git jq lz4
# for sunstone integration: node, bower, grunt
yum -y install npm
npm install bower@1.6.5 -g
npm install grunt-cli -g
# required for system operation (on all nodes)
yum -y install --enablerepo=epel lz4 jq python-lxml
```

* Clone the addon-storpool from github
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-storpool
```

### automated installation
The automated installation is best suitable for new deployments. The install script will try to do an upgrade if it detects that addon-storpool is already installed but it is possible to have errors due to non expected changes

* Run the install script as 'root' user and check for any reported errors or warnings
```bash
bash ~/addon-storpool/install.sh
```
If oned and sunstone services are on different servers it is possible to install only part of the integration:
 * set environment variable SKIP_SUNSTONE=1 to skip the sunstone integration
 * set environment variable SKIP_ONED=1 to skip the oned integration

### addon configuration
The global configuration of addon-storpool is in `/var/lib/one/remotes/addon-storpoolrc` file.

*  If you plan to do live disk snapshots with fsfreeze via qemu-guest-agent but `SCRIPTS_REMOTE_DIR` is not the default one (if it is changed in `/etc/one/oned.conf`), define `SCRIPTS_REMOTE_DIR` in the addon global configuration.

* To change disk space usage reporting to be as LVM is reporting it, define `SP_SPACE_USED_LVMWAY` variable to anything

* Add the `oneadmin` user to group `disk` on all nodes
```bash
usermod -a -G disk oneadmin
```
* Edit `/etc/one/oned.conf` and add `storpool` to the `TM_MAD` arguments
```
TM_MAD = [
    executable = "one_tm",
    arguments = "-t 15 -d dummy,lvm,shared,fs_lvm,qcow2,ssh,vmfs,ceph,dev,storpool"
]
```
* Edit `/etc/one/oned.conf` and add `storpool` to the `DATASTORE_MAD` arguments

For OpenNebula v4.x:
```
DATASTORE_MAD = [
    executable = "one_datastore",
    arguments  = "-t 15 -d dummy,fs,vmfs,lvm,ceph,dev,storpool"
]
```
For OpenNebula v5.x:
```
DATASTORE_MAD = [
    executable = "one_datastore",
    arguments  = "-t 15 -d dummy,fs,vmfs,lvm,ceph,dev,storpool  -s shared,ssh,ceph,fs_lvm,qcow2,storpool"
]
```
* Edit `/etc/one/oned.conf` and append `TM_MAD_CONF` definition for StorPool
```
TM_MAD_CONF = [
    name = "storpool", ln_target = "NONE", clone_target = "SELF", shared = "yes"
]
```
* Edit `/etc/one/oned.conf` and append DS_MAD_CONF definition for StorPool (OpenNebula v5.x)
```
DS_MAD_CONF = [
    NAME = "storpool",
    REQUIRED_ATTRS = "DISK_TYPE",
    PERSISTENT_ONLY = "NO",
    MARKETPLACE_ACTIONS = "export"
]
```
To enable live disk snapshots support for storpool
* Add `kvm-storpool` to `LIVE_DISK_SNAPSHOTS` 
For OpenNebula v4.x edit `/etc/one/kvm_exec/kvm_execrc`
```
LIVE_DISK_SNAPSHOTS="kvm-qcow2 kvm-storpool"
```
For OpenNebula v5.x edit `/etc/one/vmm_exec/vmm_execrc`
```
LIVE_DISK_SNAPSHOTS="kvm-qcow2 kvm-ceph kvm-storpool"
```
* Edit `/etc/one/oned.conf` and add `-i` argument to `VM_MAD` (OpenNebula v4.14)
```
VM_MAD = [
    name       = "kvm",
    executable = "one_vmm_exec",
    arguments  = "-i -t 15 -r 1 kvm",
    default    = "vmm_exec/vmm_exec_kvm.conf",
    type       = "kvm" ]
```
To enable the StorPool compatible Fault Tolerance `HOST_HOOK`
* Edit `/etc/one/oned.conf` and define `HOST_HOOK` as follow(tweak the arguments if needed) (OpenNebula v4.x only)
```
HOST_HOOK = [
    name      = "error",
    on        = "ERROR",
    command   = "ft/sp_host_error.rb",
    arguments = "$ID -p 2 -f fencing-script.sh",
    remote    = "no" ]
```
 When the SYSTEM datastore is on storpool (TM_MAD=storpool), to enable save/restore of the checkpoint file to a storpool volume.
* Edit/create the addon-storpool global configuration file /var/lib/one/remotes/addon-storpoolrc and define the following variable
```
SP_CHECKPOINT=yes
```
* To use the save/restore functionality for stop/resume only
```
SP_CHECKPOINT=nomigrate
```

#### space usage monitoring configuration
In OpenNebula there are three probes for datastore related monitoring. The IMAGE datastore is monitored from the front end, the SYSTEM datastore and the VM disks(and their snapshots) are monitored from the hosts. As this addon support no direct access to the StorPool API from the hosts we should provide access to the needed data to the related probes. This is done by the monitor_helper-sync script which is run via cron job on the front-end. The script is collecting the needed data and propagating(if needed) to the hosts for use. Here is the default configuration:

```
# path to the json files on the hosts 
# (must be writable by the oneadmin user)
SP_JSON_PATH="/tmp/"

# Path to the json files on the front-end
# (must be writable by the oneadmin user)
SP_FE_JSON_PATH="/tmp/monitor"

# datastores stats JSON and the command that generate them
SP_TEMPLATE_STATUS_JSON="storpool_template_status.json"
SP_TEMPLATE_STATUS_RUN="storpool -j template status"

# VM disks stats JSON and the command that generate them
SP_VOLUME_SPACE_JSON="storpool_volume_usedSpace.json"
SP_VOLUME_SPACE_RUN="storpool -j volume usedSpace"

# VM disks snapshots stats JSON and the command that generate them
SP_SNAPSHOT_SPACE_JSON="storpool_snapshot_space.json"
SP_SNAPSHOT_SPACE_RUN="storpool -j snapshot space"

# Copy(scp) the JSON files to the remote hosts
MONITOR_SYNC_REMOTE="YES"

# Do template propagate. When there is change in the template attributes
# propagate the change to all current volumes based on the template
SP_TEMPLATE_PROPAGATE="YES"

# Uncomment to enable debugging
#MONITOR_SYNC_DEBUG=1
```

For the case when there is shared filesystem between the one-fe and the HV nodes there is no need to copy the JSON files. In this case the `SP_JSON_PATH` variable must be altered to point to a shared folder and set `MONITOR_SYNC_REMOTE=NO`. The configuration change can be completed in `/var/lib/one/remotes/addon-storpoolrc` or `/var/lib/one/remotes/monitor_helper-syncrc` configuration files
_Note: the shared filesystem must be mounted on same system path on all nodes as on the one-fe!_

For example the shared file system in mounted on `/sharedfs`:
```bash
cat >>/var/lib/one/remotes/monitor_helper-syncrc <<EOF
# datastores stats on the sharedfs
export SP_JSON_PATH="/sharedfs"

# disabled remote sync
export MONITOR_SYNC_REMOTE="NO"

EOF
```

Additional configuration when there is datastore on another(non default) storpool cluster:
Include `SP_API_HTTP_HOST` `SP_API_HTTP_PORT` and `SP_AUTH_TOKEN` as additional attributes to the Datstores.

Update the Hosts:
```bash
su - oneadmin
onehist sync --force
```

### Post-install
* Restart `opennebula` and `opennebula-sunstone` services
```bash
service opennebula restart
service opennebula-sunstone restart
```
* As oneadmin user sync the remote scripts
```bash
su - oneadmin
onehost sync --force
```

## Upgrade

Follow the installation procedure. If something can not be upgraded automatically a note is printed with hints what should be done manually. Take care of such notes and follow them.

## Configuration

### Configuring the System Datastore

This addon enables full support of transfer manager (TM_MAD) backend of type shared, ssh, or storpool for the system datastore. The system datastore will hold only the symbolic links to the StorPool block devices, so it will not take much space. See more details on the [System Datastore Guide](http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/administration/storage/system_ds.html).

If TM_MAD is storpool it is possible to have both shared and ssh datastores, configured per cluster. To achieve this two attributes should be set:

* DATASTORE_LOCATION in cluster configuration should be set (pre OpenNebula 5.x+)
* By default the storpool TM_MAD is with enabled SHARED attribute (*SHARED=YES*). But if the given datastore is not shared *SP_SYSTEM=ssh* should be set in the datastore configuration

It is possible to manage different set of hosts working with different StorPool clusters from single front-end. In this case the separation of the resources in Clusters is mandatory. I this case it is highly advised to set the StorPool API details(`SP_API_HTTP_HOST`, `SP_AUTH_TOKEN` and optionally `SP_API_HTTP_PORT`) in each StorPool enabled datastore.

### Configuring the Datastore

Some configuration attributes must be set to enable an datastore as StorPool enabled one:

* **DS_MAD**: [mandatory] The DS driver for the datastore. String, use value `storpool`
* **TM_MAD**: [mandatory] Transfer driver for the datastore. String, use value `storpool`
* **DISK_TYPE**: [mandatory] Type for the VM disks using images from this datastore. String, use value `block`
* **BRIDGE_LIST**: [optional] Nodes to use for image datastore operations. String (1)
* **SP_REPLICATION**: [mandatory] The StorPool replication level for the datastore. Number (2)
* **SP_PLACEALL**: [mandatory] The name of StorPool placement group of disks where to store data. String (3)
* **SP_PLACETAIL**: [optional] The name of StorPool placement group of disks from where to read data. String (4)
* **SP_SYSTEM**: [optional] Used when StorPool datastore is used as SYSTEM_DS. Global datastore configuration for storpol TM_MAD is with *SHARED=yes* set. If the datastore is not on shared filesystem this parameter should be set to *SP_SYSTEM=ssh* to copy non-storpool files from one node to another.
* **SP_API_HTTP_HOST**: [optional] The IP address of the StorPool API to use for this datastore. IP address.
* **SP_API_HTTP_PORT**: [optional] The port of the StorPool API to use for this datastore. Number.
* **SP_AUTH_TOKEN**: [optional] The AUTH tocken for of the StorPool API to use for this datastore. String.
* **SP_BW**: [optional] The BW limit per volume on the DATASTORE.
* **SP_IOPS**: [optional] The IOPS limit per volume on the DATASTORE. Number.

1. Quoted, space separated list of server hostnames which are members of the StorPool cluster. If it is left empty the front-end must have working storpool_block service (must have access to the storpool cluster) as all disk preparations will be done locally.
1. The replication level defines how many separate copies to keep for each data block. Supported values are: `1`, `2` and `3`.
1. The PlaceAll placement group is defined in StorPool as list of drives where to store the data.
1. The PlaceTail placement group is defined in StorPool as list of drives. used in StorPool hybrid setup. If the setup is not of hybrid type leave blank or same as **SP_PLACEALL**

The following example illustrates the creation of a StorPool datastore of hybrid type with 3 replicas. In this case the datastore will use hosts node1, node2 and node3 for imports and creating images.

 ```

Note that by default OpenNebula assumes that the Datastore is accessible by all hypervisors and all bridges. If you need to configure datastores for just a subset of the hosts check the [Cluster guide](http://opennebula.org/documentation:rel4.4:cluster_guide).

### Usage

Once configured, the StorPool image datastore can be used as a backend for disk images.

Non-persistent images are StorPool volumes. When you use a non-persistent image for a VM the driver creates a new temporary volume and attaches the new volume to the VM. When the VM is destroyed, the temporary volume is deleted.

When the StorPool driver is enabled for the SYSTEM datastore the context ISO image and the volatile disks are placed on StorPool volumes. In this case on the disk is kept only VM configuration XML and the RAM dumps during migrate, suspend etc.
